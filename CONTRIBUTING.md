# Contributing

Here's help on how to make contributions, divided into the following sections:

- general information,
- pull requests and different branches recommended
- no trailing whitespace

## General information

For specific proposals, please provide them as
[pull requests](https://github.com/divio/documentation-framework/pulls)
or
[issues](https://github.com/divio/documentation-framework/issues)

You are welcome aboard!

See [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for our code of conduct;
in short, "Be excellent to each other".

## Pull requests and different branches recommended

Pull requests are preferred, since they are specific.
For more about how to create a pull request, see
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>.

We recommend creating different branches for different (logical)
changes, and creating a pull request when you're done into the master branch.
See the GitHub documentation on
[creating branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
and
[using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### No trailing whitespace

Please do not use or include trailing whitespace
(spaces or tabs at the end of a line).
Since they are often not visible, they can cause silent problems
and misleading unexpected changes.
For example, some editors (e.g., Atom) quietly delete them by default.
